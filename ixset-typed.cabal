version:             0.5.1.0
synopsis:            Efficient relational queries on Haskell sets.
description:
    This Haskell package provides a data structure of sets that are indexed
    by potentially multiple indices.
    .
    Sets can be created, modified, and queried in various ways.
    .
    The package is a variant of the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ixset ixset>
    package. The ixset package makes use
    of run-time type information to find a suitable index on a query, resulting
    in possible run-time errors when no suitable index exists. In ixset-typed,
    the types of all indices available or tracked in the type system.
    Thus, ixset-typed should be safer to use than ixset, but in turn requires
    more GHC extensions.
    .
    At the moment, the two packages are relatively compatible. As a consequence
    of the more precise types, a few manual tweaks are necessary when switching
    from one to the other, but the interface is mostly the same.
